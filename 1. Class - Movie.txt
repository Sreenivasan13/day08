1. The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)
                 class Movie{
                           var title;
                           var studio;
                           var rating;
                   }
a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.
                   constructor(title, studio, rating){
                                          this.title = title;
                                          this.studio = studio;
                                          this.rating = rating;
                     }

b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.
                       setrating(title, studio) {
                                    this.title = title;
                                    this.studio = studio;
                                    this.rating = "PG";
                       }

                    
c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.

                       getPG(Movie) {
                                   var pgMov = new Movie[mov.length];
                                   int newArrayIndex = 0;
                                   for (int i = 0; i < mov.length; i++) {
                                             if (mov[i].rating.equals("PG")) {
                                                      pgMov[newArrayIndex] = mov[i];
                                                      newArrayIndex++;
                                              }
                                    }
                                   return pgMov;
                        }

d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”
                   
                      const movie = new Movie("Casino Royale", "Eon Productions", "PG­13");
class Movie{
      constructor(title, studio, rating){
            this.title = title;
            this.studio = studio;
            this.rating = rating;
      }

      setrating(title, studio) {
            this.title = title;
            this.studio = studio;
            this.rating = "PG";
       }

        getPG(Movie) {
                         var pgMov = new Movie[mov.length];
                         int newArrayIndex = 0;
              for (int i = 0; i < mov.length; i++) {
                      if (mov[i].rating.equals("PG")) {
                           pgMov[newArrayIndex] = mov[i];
                           newArrayIndex++;
                       }
               }
              return pgMov;
        }
      
}

const movie = new Movie("Casino Royale", "Eon Productions", "PG­13");
